# Temporal convolutional network

This repository contains an implementation of the *Temporal convolutional network* (**TCN**) architecture, first presented in [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks
for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271).

The dataset used for this example can be found at [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/). In particular, a model is defined and trained for each category present in the dataset.

The code is organized in the following sections:

- [Preprocessing](./doc_preprocess.md): this section prepares data for the model;
- [Strategy filtering](./doc_model.md): this section defines and trains the model.

The phases of preprocessing and training can be controlled by the configuration file in the root directory, whose parameters are described in [Configuration](./doc_config.md).

After training with the parameters given in the configuration file, a typical prediction of the model is like the following one:
